      <p>
        I'm Jhonny! I'm a developer.
        <br />
        🌋 I'm currently improving my knowledge of the MERN Stack (NodeJS, ExpressJS, MongoDB, React). I also have knowledge in data analysis with python (Numpy, Pandas, GeoPandas and Keras) and in C++.
        <br />
        👍 I’m looking to collaborate with teams with large or small projects where I can apply my knowledge and expertise.
